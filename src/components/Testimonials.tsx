            This is the second home we've had them work on, and the results speak for themselves. In fact, in our neighborhood alone, at least 15 homes have used their services after seeing the amazing job they did for us. We also recommended them to a friend, who was just as thrilled with their work.

            If you're looking for top-notch construction and landscape design, Esmeralda Construction, with Jose and Luis on the team, is the way to go. Highly recommended`,
